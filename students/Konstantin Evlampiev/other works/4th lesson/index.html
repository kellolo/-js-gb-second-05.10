                            A: 'How do you feel when you fly?'
                            B: 'I love it. I really love flying. I like going to different places, it doesn't matter how long it takes. I just love flying.'
                            A: 'What do you least like about flying?'
                            B: 'The meals on the plane, that's what I don't like about flying.'
                            A: 'Have you ever had a frustrating experience when you were flying?'
                            B: 'Yes, I did actually. Last year, but it wasn't actually on the plane, it was beforehand. I had too much luggage at Delhi airport and they wouldn't let me on the plane and they were trying to say that I'd have to pay a lot of money. But eventually I bribed somebody!'
                            A: 'How do you feel when you fly?'
                            B: 'I love flying, I do.'
                            A: 'What do you least like about flying?'
                            B: 'I don't like turbulence a lot because when it shakes it makes me a little nervous. But I like flying because you're isolated and you can't use your cell phone or anything, I like that.'
                            A: 'Have you ever had a frustrating experience when you were flying?'
                            B: 'Yeah, one time they lost my baggage, so I had to spend my holiday without my luggage.'
                            A: 'How do you feel when you fly?'
                            B: 'Predominantly comfortable, I think it's a state of mind.'
                            A: 'What do you least like about flying?'
                            B: 'That I'm not in control of the situation that I'm, that I'm putting my safety in someone else's hands.'
                            A: 'Have you ever had a frustrating experience when you were flying?'
                            B: 'Air travel, security-wise is very frustrating - not being able to take things on a plane and huge queues at airports.'
